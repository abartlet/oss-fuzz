"""Uses bisection to determine which commit a bug was introduced and fixed.

This module takes a high and a low commit SHA, a repo name, and a bug.
The module bisects the high and low commit SHA searching for the location
where the bug was introduced. It also looks for where the bug was solved.
This is done with the following steps:
  Typical usage example:
    1. (Host) Clone the main project repo on the host
    2. (Host) Run git fetch --unshallow
    3. (Host) Use git bisect to identify the next commit to check
    4. (Client) Build the image at the specific commit using git hooks
    5. (Host) Build the fuzzers from new image with updated repo
    6. (Host) Test for bugâ€™s existence
    7. Go to step 3

    python bisect.py --project_name curl 
      --commit_new 7627a2dd9d4b7417672fdec3dc6e7f8d3de379de
      --commit_old e80b5c801652bdd8aa302345954c3ef8050d039a
